## ⏱️ Deployment Timeline

### What Happens During Deployment:

**Minute 1-2: Building**
```
==> Installing dependencies
==> pip install -r requirements.txt
==> Installing Flask, gunicorn, cryptography...
```

**Minute 2-3: Starting**
```
==> Starting server
==> gunicorn app:app
==> Your app is live!
```

**Total Time: 2-3 minutes** ⚡

## 🌐 Access Your App

Once deployed, you'll get a URL like:
```
https://blockchain-file-sharing-xxxx.onrender.com
```

**Click the URL** to open your blockchain file sharing system!

---

## 🔧 Post-Deployment Configuration

### Update Frontend API URL

After deployment, update your JavaScript to use the production URL:

**File**: `static/script_advanced.js`

Change line 2:
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://your-app-name.onrender.com/api';
```

Replace `your-app-name` with your actual Render URL.

Then commit and push:
```bash
git add static/script_advanced.js
git commit -m "Update API URL for production"
git push origin main
```

Render will **auto-deploy** the changes!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Failed?

**Check Python version:**
```yaml
# In render.yaml
- key: PYTHON_VERSION
  value: 3.13.0
```

```bash
# Make sure all dependencies are listed
Flask==3.0.0
gunicorn==21.2.0
cryptography==41.0.7
```

### App Not Starting?

**Check start command:**
```
gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
```

**View logs** in Render dashboard for error details.
